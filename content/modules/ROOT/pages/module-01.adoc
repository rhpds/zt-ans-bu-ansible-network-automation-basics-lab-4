== For this challenge we will examine an already created Ansible Playbook


=== Network Facts

Topics Covered:

- Facts for Network Devices
- The debug module

link:red.ht/NetworkDocs[red.ht/NetworkDocs]

Specific Network Automation Section for Ansible including a getting started guide

=== Accessing the Ansible docs

With the use of the latest command utility ansible-navigator, one can trigger access to all the modules available to them as well as details on specific modules.

[source,bash]
----
$ ansible-navigator doc -l -m stdout
add_host
amazon.aws.aws_az_facts
amazon.aws.aws_caller_facts
amazon.aws.aws_caller_info

----

A formal introduction to ansible-navigator and how it can be used to run playbooks in the following exercise.

=== Lets get started

That is the end of of your lab briefing!

Once the lab is setup you can click the Green start button image:https://github.com/IPvSean/pictures_for_github/blob/master/start_button.png?raw=true[width=100px,align=left] in the bottom right corner of this window.


=== Step 1 - Using documentation

Enter the `ansible-navigator` interactive mode on the terminal tab

[source,bash]
----
ansible-navigator
----

You will see the following:
----
`:doc <plugin>`
----

To show how this works,  use the `debug` module by typing `:doc debug`

[source,bash]
----
:doc debug
----

The documentation for the `debug` module is now displayed in you interactive terminal session.  This is a YAML representation of the same exact documentation you would see on link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/debug_module.html[docs.ansible.com].  Examples can be cut and paste directly from the module documentation into your Ansible Playbook.

When referring to a non-built in module, there is three important fields:

----
namespace.collection.module
----
.For example:
----
cisco.ios.facts
----

*Explanation of terms:*

- *namespace* - example *cisco* - A namespace is grouping of multiple collections.  The *cisco* namespace contains multiple collections including *ios*, *nxos*, and *iosxr*.

- *collection* - example *ios* - A collection is a distribution format for Ansible content that can include playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins.  The *ios* collection contains all the modules for Cisco IOS/IOS-XE

- *module* - example facts - Modules are discrete units of code that can be used in a playbook task. For example the *facts* modules will return structured data about that specified system.

Press the *Esc* key to return to the main menu.  Try repeating the `:doc` command with the `cisco.ios.facts` module.

[source,bash]
----
:doc cisco.ios.facts
----

We will be using the facts module in our playbook.
