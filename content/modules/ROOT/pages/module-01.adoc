= Create a network banner automation job template



== Basics Lab 4

*Challenge 1, learn how to create a Network-Banner job template in Automation controller*

== Lab 4 - Learning about Ansible Automation Platform Surveys

Demonstrate the use of automation controller https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html#surveys[survey feature]. Surveys set extra variables for the playbook similar to 'Prompt for Extra Variables', but in a user-friendly question and answer way. Surveys allow for validation of user input.

== Survey

An Ansible Controller survey is a simple question-and-answer form that allows users to customize their job runs. Combine that with Controller's role-based access control, and you can build simple, easy self-service for your users.

Use cases for surveys are numerous. An example might be if operations wanted to give developers a "push to stage" button they could run without advanced Ansible knowledge. When launched, this task could prompt for answers to questions such as, "What tag should we release?"

Many types of questions can be asked, including multiple-choice questions.
