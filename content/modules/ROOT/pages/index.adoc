Learn about retrieving facts from a Cisco IOS-XE device.

== Ansible Network Automation Basics - Facts


=== **Lab Objective: Demonstration use of Ansible facts on network infrastructure**

Ansible facts are information derived from speaking to the remote network elements.  Ansible facts are returned in structured data (JSON) that makes it easy manipulate or modify.  For example a network engineer could create an audit report very quickly using Ansible facts and templating them into a markdown or HTML file.

.This exercise will cover:
* Building an Ansible Playbook from scratch.
* Using `ansible-navigator :doc` for documentation
* Using the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/cisco/ios/ios_facts_module.html[cisco.ios.facts module].
* Using the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/debug_module.html[debug module].
